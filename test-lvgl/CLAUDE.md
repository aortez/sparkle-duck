The project features **dual physics systems**:
- **RulesA**: Original dirt/water simulation with mixed materials per cell
- **RulesB**: New pure-material system with fill ratios and enhanced material types (default)

## Architecture

### Dual Physics Systems

#### RulesB (Default) - Pure Material System
- **WorldB**: Grid-based physics simulation using CellB
- **CellB**: Fill ratio [0,1] with pure materials (AIR, DIRT, WATER, WOOD, SAND, METAL, LEAF, WALL)  
- **MaterialType**: Enum-based material system with material-specific properties

#### RulesA (Legacy) - Mixed Material System  
- **World**: Original grid-based simulation using Cell (should be renamed WorldA)
- **Cell**: Individual simulation units with mixed dirt/water amounts
- **WorldRules**: Complex physics with pressure systems and material mixing

### Shared Components
- **Vector2d**: 2D floating point mathematics for physics calculations
- **Vector2i**: 2D integer mathematics for physics calculations
- **SimulatorUI**: LVGL-based interface supporting both physics systems

### UI Framework
- **SimulatorUI**: LVGL-based interface with real-time physics controls
- **Interactive Elements**: Smart cell grabber with intelligent material interaction
- **Visual Controls**: Live sliders for gravity, elasticity, pressure parameters

### Smart Cell Grabber
The intelligent interaction system provides seamless material manipulation:

**Features**:
- **Smart Interaction**: Automatically detects user intent based on cell content
- **Material Addition**: Click empty cells to add selected material type
- **Material Dragging**: Click occupied cells to grab and drag existing material
- **Floating Particle Preview**: Real-time visual feedback with particle following cursor
- **Physics-Based Tossing**: Drag velocity translates to material momentum on release
- **Collision Foundation**: Infrastructure for particle-world collision interactions

**Material Selection**:
- **8-Material Grid**: Choose from DIRT, WATER, WOOD, SAND, METAL, LEAF, WALL, AIR
- **Visual Material Picker**: 4Ã—2 grid layout with color-coded material buttons
- **Cross-World Support**: Material selection works with both WorldA and WorldB

**User Experience**:
- **No Mode Switching**: System intelligently handles both add and grab operations
- **Sub-Cell Precision**: Accurate center-of-mass calculation from cursor position
- **Velocity Tracking**: Recent position history enables realistic physics momentum
- **Visual Feedback**: Floating particles show exactly what's being manipulated

### Physics Features

#### RulesB (Current Default)
- Pure material cells with fill ratios [0,1] 
- Material-specific density affecting gravity response
- Velocity limiting (max 0.9 cells/timestep, 10% slowdown above 0.5)
- Center of mass (COM) physics within [-1,1] bounds
- 8 material types: AIR, DIRT, WATER, WOOD, SAND, METAL, LEAF, WALL
- Wall boundaries with material reflection (planned)
- Transfer/pressure systems (in development)

#### RulesA (Legacy)
- Mixed dirt/water materials per cell
- Complex pressure systems (COM-based, hydrostatic, iterative settling)
- Density-based material swapping and realistic material behavior  
- Time reversal capability (step backward/forward)
- Fragmentation and advanced physics parameters

## Testing Framework

Uses GoogleTest with custom visual test framework supporting both physics systems:

### RulesB Tests
- **WorldBVisual_test.cpp**: Material initialization, empty world advancement, material properties
- Basic physics validation for the new pure-material system

### RulesA Tests  
- **WorldVisual_test.cpp**: Complex physics scenarios (momentum transfer, boundary reflection)
- **PressureSystemVisual_test.cpp**: Pressure system validation
- **DensityMechanics_test.cpp**: Material density and swapping mechanics

### Shared Tests
- **Vector2d_test.cpp**: 2D mathematics validation
- **UI component tests**: SimulatorUI functionality

Visual tests can display simulation while running when `SPARKLE_DUCK_VISUAL_TESTS=1` is enabled.

## Development Environment

### Display Backends
Supports SDL, Wayland, X11, and Linux FBDEV backends. Primary development is Linux-focused with Wayland backend as default.

### IDE Integration
- ClangD configuration (`.clangd`)
- Generated `compile_commands.json` for LSP support
- AI development setup (`.aiignore`)

### Performance Tools
- Built-in timing systems and FPS tracking
- Debug visualization modes
- Screenshot capture functionality
- Memory profiling capabilities

## Logging

The application uses spdlog for structured logging with dual output:

### Log Outputs
- **Console**: INFO level and above (colored output)
- **File**: DEBUG/TRACE level and above (`sparkle-duck.log`)

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: Important events (startup, world creation, user interactions)
- **DEBUG**: Moderate frequency events (drag updates, timestep tracking)
- **TRACE**: High-frequency per-frame events (pressure systems, physics details)

### Log Files
- **File**: `sparkle-duck.log` (overwrites on each run)
- **Location**: Same directory as executable
- **Behavior**: File is truncated at startup for fresh logs each session

You can troubleshoot behavior by examining the TRACE logs.

## Key Implementation Details

### Smart Cell Grabber Architecture
The cell grabber system in WorldB uses a sophisticated floating particle approach:

**Core Components**:
- **Floating Particle**: `has_floating_particle_` + `floating_particle_` for visual preview
- **Position Tracking**: Precise pixel-level positioning with sub-cell COM calculation
- **Velocity System**: Recent position history for realistic physics momentum transfer
- **Collision Detection**: `checkFloatingParticleCollision()` and `handleFloatingParticleCollision()`

**Intelligent Interaction Logic**:
```cpp
// Smart behavior in startDragging():
// - Empty cells: addMaterialAtPixel() adds selected material, then drag starts
// - Occupied cells: drag starts immediately with existing material
// - No mode switching needed - context determines behavior
```

**Physics Integration**:
- **Sub-cell precision**: COM calculated from exact cursor position within cell
- **Momentum conservation**: Drag velocity transferred to material on release
- **Collision foundation**: Density-based collision detection ready for enhancement
- **Material properties**: Each material type has specific collision behavior

**Future Collision Expansion Points**:
- `handleFloatingParticleCollision()` has TODO sections for elastic collisions, splash effects, fragmentation
- Collision system designed for material-specific behaviors (METAL bouncing, WATER splashing)
- Ready for "wreaking havoc" scenarios with high-velocity particle interactions

## Universal Floating Particle System - Implementation Plan

### Design Reconciliation with GridMechanics.md

The current GridMechanics.md design already describes a **particle-within-cell** system that aligns well with universal floating particles:

âœ… **Already Compatible:**
- Each cell contains a particle with COM [-1,1] and velocity
- 2D kinematics with realistic boundary crossing physics
- Momentum conservation during transfers
- Material properties (elasticity, cohesion, adhesion, density)
- Neighbor-based interaction system

ðŸ”„ **Enhancement Needed:**
- Extend collision detection from transfer-only to full collision physics
- Add material-specific collision behaviors for all neighbor interactions
- Implement chain reaction mechanics through particle networks
- Enable "wreaking havoc" scenarios with high-energy collisions

### Collision Implementation Todos
- [x] Implement elastic collision handler for METAL-METAL interactions
- [ ] Add splash effect system for WATER collisions
- [ ] Create fragmentation mechanics for brittle materials
- [x] Design absorption/penetration behaviors (WATER+DIRT, etc.)
- [ ] Implement absorption/penetration behaviors (WATER+DIRT, etc.)

## Misc TODO
[x] - Add an exit hook that shows a full dump of the world state after an ASSERT.
[ ] - some way to talk to the application while it runs... a DBus API, a socket API, what are the other options? This would be useful!
[x] - run a clean build and fix all warnings, then make all warnings into errors. Please.
[ ] - Consider design of Air/Nothing materials and examine currently implementation.
[ ] - Add a Makefile to capture some common targets ('clean', 'debug', 'release', 'test-all'... anything else?); update CLAUDE.md with instructions.
[ ] - In WorldB, Update left click, so if it is on a currently on a filled cell that is not the selected type, or is not full, fill it with the selected type.
[ ] - How can we make denser materials sink below less dense ones?
[ ] - Physics systems should be toggleable.
